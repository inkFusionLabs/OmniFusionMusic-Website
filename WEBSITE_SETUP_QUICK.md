# 🚀 Quick Fix for Your Website Callback

## ❌ **The Problem**
After authorizing on Spotify, your website shows the main page instead of the authorization code.

## ✅ **The Solution**
Upload the callback page to your website to handle the OAuth redirect properly.

## 📋 **Quick Setup (5 minutes)**

### 1. **Upload the Callback Page**
Upload the file `website-callback-fix.html` to your website at:
```
https://www.omnifusionmusic.com/spotify-callback
```

### 2. **Test the Complete Flow**
1. **Open the app** at `http://localhost:1420`
2. **Go to Settings** → **Music Services**
3. **Click "Connect Spotify"**
4. **Authorize on Spotify**
5. **Your website should now show the authorization code**
6. **Copy the code and paste it in the app**

## 🎯 **What the Callback Page Does**

- ✅ **Extracts the authorization code** from the URL
- ✅ **Shows a beautiful success page** with the code
- ✅ **Auto-copies the code** to clipboard
- ✅ **Provides clear instructions** for the user
- ✅ **Handles errors gracefully**

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

The callback page:
- Gets the `code` parameter from the URL
- Displays it in a user-friendly format
- Provides a "Copy Code" button
- Auto-copies the code after 1 second
- Shows clear next steps

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

Once you upload the callback page, the complete flow will work:

1. **App** → Opens Spotify auth
2. **Spotify** → User authorizes
3. **Your Website** → Shows authorization code
4. **User** → Copies code and returns to app
5. **App** → Connects to Spotify

**Upload the file and test the connection!** 🎵
