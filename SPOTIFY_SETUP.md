## Step 4: Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```env
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid redirect URI"**: Make sure the redirect URI in your Spotify app matches exactly: `http://localhost:1420/callback`
- **"Client ID not found"**: Check that your `.env` file is in the project root and has the correct variable names
- **"Invalid client secret"**: Double-check your client secret in the `.env` file
