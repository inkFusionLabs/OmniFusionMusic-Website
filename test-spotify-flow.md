# ðŸ§ª Test Spotify OAuth Flow

## âœ… **Let's Test Your Complete Setup**

Now that you've added the callback to your website, let's test the complete flow.

## ðŸ“‹ **Test Steps**

### 1. **Verify Spotify App Settings**
Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and make sure you have:
```
https://www.omnifusionmusic.com/spotify-callback
```

### 2. **Test the Complete Flow**
1. **Open the app** at `http://localhost:1420`
2. **Go to Settings** â†’ **Music Services**
3. **Click "Connect Spotify"**
4. **Complete authorization in browser**
5. **Check what happens after authorization**

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Should Happen**

### **Expected Flow:**
1. **Click "Connect Spotify"** â†’ Opens Spotify auth in browser
2. **Authorize on Spotify** â†’ Redirects to your website
3. **Your website shows** â†’ Authorization code or success page
4. **Copy code** â†’ User copies the code
5. **Paste in app** â†’ Return to app and paste
6. **Connected!** â†’ Spotify is connected

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**

#### **Issue: Redirects to main website page**
- **Solution**: Your callback page needs to handle the `/spotify-callback` route specifically

#### **Issue: "Invalid redirect URI" error**
- **Solution**: Make sure the exact URL is added to Spotify app settings

#### **Issue: No authorization code shown**
- **Solution**: Your callback page needs to extract and display the `code` parameter

## ðŸ”§ **Quick Fix for Your Website**

If your website is showing the main page instead of a callback page, you need to:

1. **Create a specific route** for `/spotify-callback`
2. **Handle the OAuth parameters** (`code`, `state`, `error`)
3. **Display the authorization code** clearly

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Test!**

The app is running and ready. Let's test the complete flow and see what happens!

**Try the connection now and let me know what you see!** ðŸŽµ
